  <h3>According to the Thomas B. Fordham institute, cell phones prevent socialisation between students during school as with many forms of social media students would rather talk to random people online than the people in their very own school. As stated by the Fordham institute “Ask a veteran teacher what’s changed in recent decades, and the first thing they’re likely to mention is kids not talking to one another anymore. Some can barely initiate or sustain a conversation with a same-age peer. They don’t have the practice. Others wear AirPods like security blankets. Phone bans are seen as restoring critical interactions that kids missed—to their lasting detriment—during Covid closures.”</h3>

  <h3>According to familyeducation.com phones are nothing more than a distraction, “students often forget to turn off their phones in class and ringing noises or text message alerts disrupt learning and school work. Even if set to silent, cell phones can still cause distraction for students and educators, since text messaging has become a high-tech method of passing notes in school.”</h3>
